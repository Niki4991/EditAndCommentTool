## Overview
VerticalSlider is a vertically oriented UISlider control embedded in a UIView. As an `@IBDesignable` class, it renders vertically in Interface Builder and visual properties of the slider have been exposed in the _Attributes Inspector_ for convenience. The underlying UISlider control can be accessed through VerticalSlider's `slider` property.

Check out the example project to see it in action!

## Requirements
* iOS 9 or higher.

## Installation
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate VerticalSlider into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'VerticalSlider'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage
### Storyboard Implementation
1. Create a View for a VerticalSlider. Set the custom class of the View to be `VerticalSlider` in the **Identity Inspector**. Interface Builder should update the view to show a VerticalSlider.

2. Configure VerticalSlider's properties any way you like!

### Code Implementation
First:
```swift
import VerticalSlider
```

Next, declare your VerticalSlider at the top of your View Controller and link it in Interface Builder:
```swift
@IBOutlet var verticalSlider: VerticalSlider!
```

You can link any `@IBAction` to Interface Builder events or you can programmatically respond to events the same way you do with the standard `UISlider` control. 

Programmatic example - in your View Controller's `viewDidLoad` event:
``` swift
verticalSlider.addTarget(self, action: #selector(sliderChanged), for: .valueChanged)
```
Then add the method that will be called when the slider's value changes:
``` swift
func sliderChanged() {
    // your code here
    print(verticalSlider.value)
}
```
That's it.

## Code
This is a simple library contained in a single file. If you prefer to add it manually instead of taking a dependency, here's the [code](https://github.com/jonkykong/VerticalSlider/blob/master/VerticalSlider/Classes/VerticalSlider.swift).
